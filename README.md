# ManFight
Two classes Man and ManFight that together make a fun little text game

This was made to amuse my non-techie husband and make him pay attention to my explanation of the code, 
I managed to get his attention for a minute so, win.  I am just a beginner, part way through Tim Bulchalka's course, https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/, so be kind.  

## How to Run
To compile the project run:
```
javac -d . Main.java Man.java ManFight.java CharacterCreation.java
```
and then to run the project:
```
java com.crystal.Main
```

This game has been improved a ton since I opened it up for hacktoberfest, I love that no one has made me feel bad for being a newbie with sloppy code and poor github skills. Everyone who has contributed to this game I just want to say thatthis has been a really fun experience so far, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the month.
